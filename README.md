LogicAl is multipurpose functional declarative language.

It can be used for representation of many things:
  1. Acyclic data processing graphs.
  2. Projects of software build systems.
  3. Stream processing graphs.

Future versions will support representation of theorems and their proofs.

All these things can be represented in textual form or in form of graphical 
diagrams. Any program in this language can be represented graphically.
