**Purpose of the Language:**

The language is designed to enable a collaborative programming paradigm between human programmers and AI, focusing not only on creating programs but also on defining transformation pipelines that generate final artifacts, such as executables and resources, through structured transformations. This approach goes beyond traditional programming by allowing both the creation of programs and the orchestration of transformations that refine them into deployable forms.

This language serves several core purposes:

1. **AI-Human and Human-Human Communication Medium**: It acts as a shared language where humans and AI can clearly articulate program specifications, intentions, and transformation sequences. By defining both the "what" (the intended outcome) and the "how" (the transformation steps), it bridges human intuition with AI-assisted automation.

2. **Transformation System**: Beyond writing individual programs, the language enables developers and AI to collaboratively design transformation pipelines. These pipelines incrementally transform a core, abstract program representation into its final, executable form. A strictly specified core representation ensures that transformations are predictable and verifiable.

3. **Formal Reasoning and Proofs**: At the core of this language lies a dependent type system similar to Agda's, which provides a robust foundation for reasoning about program properties and proving their correctness. This type system not only ensures the soundness of transformations but also enables rigorous proofs about program behavior, safety, and performance properties, establishing a high level of trust in both the code and the transformations.

In essence, this language is a framework for building adaptive, transformation-driven systems that leverage AI as an active collaborator, using a mathematically rigorous foundation to ensure both correctness and expressiveness.
