On the model level the language consists of following basic constructions:

1. Variables (x)
2. Function definitions (x => y)
3. Function applications (x y)
4. Types (TYPE)
5. Productions (x -> y)

But on syntactical level it has additional constructions:

1. Operators and constructors
2. Pattern matchers
3. Literals
4. Imports and exports

## Operators

* +, -, *, /, % - arithmetics
* ==, !=, <, <=, >, >= - comparison
* [], . - indexers

## Constructors

* @{a: Int, b: String} - structure types
* {a: 1, b: "2"} - structures
* Int * String - tuple types
* (2, "dd") - tuples
* Int[] - array types
* [2, 3, 4] - arrays

## Literals

"Some String" - string literals. They produce lists of characters (@l())
132, -33 - integer literals. They can have any length, constrained only by size of memory.
1.22e33 - floating point literals. Also can have any size.

## Variables

x, X, var1, \_a - alfa-numeric string (?) representing reference to variables with a given name. 
x^ - this construction ('^' symbolizes vector) allows to capture all variables with the name 'x' visible in a given scope. It will generate model with list of values of those variables.

## Function declarations

### Examples
`x => x`, `x, y => x * y`, `_ => null`, `x; y => x * y`, `(1, x) => x`

### Semantic tree generation
Simple function declaration generates abstraction annotated by name of declared variable. `x => x` converts to $(\lambda v)_{name("x")}$. Underline instead of variable name leads to removal of name annotation and makes resulting abstraction unboundable: `_ => null` $\rArr$ $\Lambda v$

Pattern in a left part of function definition leads to use of destructuring function in semantic tree. `x, y => x * y` $\rArr$ $(\lambda v)(v_0, v_1)$

## Function Applications

`f 1`, `someFunction(1, x)` - Application of function to some value. In second example the
value is tuple. Generates model: @apply(f, 1), @apply(someFunction, @tuple (@pair 1 x)) where @apply is function capable of pattern matching of function arguments. In conjunction with variable lists it allows to implement function overloading.

## Imports

Imports are done using special type of function which must always have constant string argument. Syntax:
module1 = import "module1";

## Exports
Exports mark variables to be included into structure which will become a module's value
export f = x => x * x;
Will be automatically converted into
f = x => x * x;
{f}
To finally become:
{f: x => x * x}
In first version of the language exports are not needed, but should be added later.
